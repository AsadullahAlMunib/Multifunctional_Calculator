# Multifunctional_Calculator 

This is a ***[Multifunctional_Calculator](https://github.com/AsadullahAlMunib/Multifunctional_Calculator/blob/main/Multifunctional_Calculator.c )*** programmed in C language. 

It provides the following functionalities:

**1. Basic Calculator:** Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**2. Triangle Math:** Calculate the area and perimeter of a triangle.

**3. Square Math:** Calculate the area and perimeter of a square.

**4. Circle Math:** Calculate the area and circumference of a circle.

Therefore, if you want to use it, you need to use A compiler that supports the <conio.h> Header File.




***Note:*** If you don't have the **<conio.h> Header File**, you can use the 2nd Program: **[2_Multifunctional_Calculator](https://github.com/AsadullahAlMunib/Multifunctional_Calculator/blob/main/2_Multifunctional_Calculator.c)**
